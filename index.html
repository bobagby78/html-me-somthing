        <h1>Boring Stories from my Boring Life</h1>
        <p><h2>A Gringo in Paradise</h2>by Jon Bagby</p>
        <h1>Back Story</h1>

        <p>Back story: I am a teacher, have been for the past 12 years. I am a gringo who teaches Spanish in the United States. 
        More back story: I was a bit of a nerd in high school. The only sport I played was Marching Band, and the only class
        I liked more than band was Spanish Class. It just came to me. I never had to study, never had to take notes, never had to 
        do much more than just show up, and I got A's. However, I was one of the worst students on the planet. When I opened my locker door, 
        it was a sea of homework assignments just thrown in the mix. Most of them incomplete. So when the guidance counselor at the school
        asked me what I was thinking of doing after high school, and I told her I wanted to be a teacher, she more or less told me that was
        simply not in the cards. Challenge accepted. To move this story along, I went to SWIC for 2 years and got all my gen eds out of the way.
        Then I wasted a year or two living with some friends in Champaign, and then I enrolled at SIUE in their Foreign Languages and Lit program 
        from which I graduated Magna Cum Laude. (Would have been Summa Cum Laude if I didn't hate my linguistics class.)

                        <p>Fast Forward a couple decades and now I am pretty darn okayish at what I do. As a chronic sufferer of the dreaded Impostor Syndrom, that's the best compliment I will ever allow myself to give myslef.
                        So, anyway, I know some other Spanish teacher types who have taken their students on trips
                        to foreign countries to <em>'immerse themselves in the culture.'</em> So I say to myself, why don't I take some students on a  trip. I did my study abroad in 
                        Costa Rica where I lived with a lovely old lady named Miriam and went to classes for half a day. In the other half of the day I had free time to
                        wander around and get lost in a foreign country, which, as it happens, is one of my favorite pastimes. I have always wanted to go back to Costa Rica, even toying with the
                        idea of moving there in some capacity. So I went for it. I polled my classes to see who was interested in going on a trip with Sr. bagby to Central America and around 23 students
                        said "Oh hell yeah, I'm totally going to go to Costa Rica with you". a year later my sister and I took 4 students to Costa Rica. Apparently the idea of saving money to do something
                        totally awesome does not compare to buying those dope ass shoes I saw at Journey's last week.

                    <p><alt>Just a gringo living his best life in the tropics</alt></p>
                        <p>
                        So, we arrived in Costa Rica. I didn't lose any students on the way there, so that was a huge bonus. The airport experience was pretty standard. The plane lands, all the gringos 
                        disembark and work their way through customs. If you have all your necessary documentation, it's pretty easy to get through. Supposedly if you don't have your passport on you when you 
                        walk through Customs they just put you on a plane back home, where you may or may not be able to get back into the United States. I thought that was weird, but apparently some people are able to
                        schmooze their way through the airport and get onto a flight by playing dumb all the way there. I don't know from first-hand experience, so it's whatever. We found our way through customs and into the exterior
                        of the airport where our tour guide was waiting for us. After an hour of sitting around waiting for all the tour groups to work their way out of the airport, we went to the hotel.
                        Our first big destination was Monteverde.

                    <h1>El Bosque Nuboso</h1>
                    <img src = "images/bosqueNuboso.jpg"></img>
                        <p>
                        There was a 'day trip'on the way to Monteverde. We stopped at a school and dropped off supplies, toured the facility, spoke to some kids. All that 
                        good stuff. My favorit part of the whole thing was recess. All the kids descended on the playground like a bunch of energetic monsters looking to run off a few hours worth of pent up energy. 
                        It's Central America, so naturally the pastime of choice was fútbol. Students and tourists alike made it to the soccer pitch, split up teams, kids vs. adults, and had the hottest, 
                        most awesome soccer match for about 30 minutes. Quick reminder, it's Central America, the tropics, so it's about 85 degrees, and 85% humidity and by the time the game was 'over', I 
                        had completely soaked my shirt and had nothing to change into. Worth it!

                    <h1>Volcán Arenal, edit: Croc Tour</h1>
                    <img src = "images/crocTour.jpg"></img>
                        <p>
                        This was the only part of the trip that was, in any way shape or form, a bust. We were supposed to take a trip to one of the most impressive live volcanoes in the Americas and hike about half way 
                        up the cone, but Mpther Nature had different plans. It had rained off and on for a week, and then on the day of the Volcano trip, it poured buckets. An aguacero, as they say in Costa Rica. The pop-up shower was
                        so intense that it washed out the only road between the world and the  foot of the volcano. We were at least forunate enough to have an excursion scheduled later in the day. There were about 5 buses and 5 buses worth
                        of tourists trapped at the foot of the volcano with the road leading away from the volcano washed out. So instead, we took the money set aside for Arenal, and put it toward a Croc tour, which completely made up for the 
                        busted volcano trip. 
                        <br></br>
                        While around Arenal, we did a couple more completely awesome things that are completely outside of my comfort zone. I am afraid of heights. I am afraid of falling from great heights. So, what's the most logical thing 
                        someone with acrophobia to do? Go on a hanging bridge and ziplining tour. Heck yes, makes all the sense in the world. Again, worth it.

                    <h1>Playa Jacó</h1>
                    <img src = "images/pitStop.jpg"></img>
                        <p>
                        Another awesome 2 days of the whirlwind Costa Rica Tour were spent in a surfing town called Jacó. apparently this place is a world renowned surfing spot. I had some slight aspirations of renting a board and getting in 
                        some surf time, but that just wasn't in the stars. These trips have pretty much every hour of every day accounted for and packed with activities and or travel time to get to the activities. So while I didn't actually get to surf,
                        I was able to spend some time swimming in the ocean. The beaches at Jacó were all volcanic sand, so they were either charcoal gray or black, but the odd thing about the volcanic sand is that it doesn't get very hot. So that was
                        pretty cool... See what I did there?

                    <h1>Manuel Antonio</h1>
                    <img src= "images/monkeys.jpg"></img>
                    <p><alt>Just a couple of monkeys hanging out in a tree</alt></p>
                        <p>
                        And now to one of my favorite parts of the trip. There's a National park in Costa Rica called Manuel Antonio. I visited there in 2005. Unofficially, we snuck in the side instead of going through the entrance. Cost us about 
                        &#8353 1000 , or $2, instead of the $20 that they charge at the entrance. when my students committed to taking the trip to Costa Rica I specifically looked for a trip that would take me back there, since it was one of the best National 
                        Parks I have ever visited, anywhere, in the whole world. This place is full of Capuchin monkeys, Howler monkeys, Quetzales, Two-toed and Three-toed sloths. It's amazing. Oh, and I kicked a shark there once, too. But that's a whole other story. 
                        This was the whipped cream on top of the trip. Everyone who went with me agreed with me in saying that it was the most beautiful place they had ever visited in their entire lives. Well worth the $20 entrance fee to get in. A lot of us
                        checked "Seeing a wild sloth in the Costa Rican rainforest" off of our bucket lists. I'm pretty sure at least one person even cried. Might've been me.

                    <h1>Back to the buttcrack of the planet</h1>
                        <p> 
                        As awesome as the trip was, we all knew it would have to come to an end, and then we would return to our normal old boring lives in the buttcrack of the planet. You know, that place between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.
                        The midwest, AKA, the planet's buttcrack. So here we are. I'm personally looking for my next big adventure. Another trip to another tropical Paradise. Maybe Panamá, Maybe Guatemala. I suppose I'll have to wait for the world to return to a semi-
                        normal pre-covid state before I can make any plans to take anyone to the tropics. I think next time, it'll have to be my wife and kids. They also need to experience the wild beauty of the rainforests before we all get caught back up in our 
                        grind.
